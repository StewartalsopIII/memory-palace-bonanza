The old Parthenon stood silent in the Buenos Aires twilight. María had walked past it a thousand times, but tonight something was different - a faint blue glow emanated from between the ancient columns. As she climbed the marble steps, she heard what sounded like whispers in a dozen different languages, all overlapping. The massive wooden door, usually locked, stood slightly ajar. She pushed it open and gasped at what she saw inside.
